CS 300 DSA: Analysis and Design Class

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For the projects in this class, I was trying to create a program for a university, ABCU that helps students choose their classes. This program needed to store information about the courses, and retrieve that information when called for efficiently. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by trying different data structures to see which method would work best, and I found that a binary search tree would be the best for my program. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I ran into several issues throughout the projects including the implementation of the binary search tree. It was complicated for me to fully understand because it involves so many moving parts, especially understanding the way the nodes move through the tree. One thing that helped me was naming the pointer and node variables very specifically so I could clearly see which parts of the program I was referring to. Referring back to other assignments in the course was helpful too as well as rereading chapters of our zyBook. I even watched some YouTube videos to clarify some concepts. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

In this course we had to write pseudocode many times. This is something I have done in previous classes, however I found the repitition of it particularly helpful in this class. I think having to rewrite/add to/modify similar code so many times gave me a different perspective of how to look at a program. That is something I will really take away and use going forward, how essential planning out the pseudocode before starting the actual code is. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think this project has made me realize the importance of considering the adaptability of my code from the beginning. Being able to switch out difference data structures is really important to build the most efficient program, and it can save you a lot of time if you write it to be able to try different things out from the beginning.
